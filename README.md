CBR Chemically Based Rendering

Chemical-based rendering is a rendering method based on the principle 
that the colors of electrons, atoms, elements and molecules, and polymeric organic compounds appear.

It uses a molecular bonding structure method based on electrons, 
which is different from the existing texture-based method.

Our goal is a data-based, algorithm-based surface treatment method.

In connection with this, physical laws can be formed.
